# 1.For each of the following statements, indicate whether it is True/False. If false, explain why.

I.The sample size of the survey should at least be a fixed percentage of the population size in order to produce representative results.

Ans:  False. The sample should be selected with random sampling based on the problem you want to solve
.
II.The sampling frame is a list of every item that appears in a survey sample, including those that did not respond to questions.

Ans:  The sampling frame refers to the list or set of items from which the sample is selected. It should ideally include all elements of the target population. However, it does not include those individuals who did not respond to the survey or refused to participate. 

III.Larger surveys convey a more accurate impression of the population than smaller surveys.

Ans : True

2.PC Magazine asked all of its readers to participate in a survey of their satisfaction with different brands of electronics. In the 2004 survey, which was included in an issue of the magazine that year, more than 9000 readers rated the products on a scale from 1 to 10. The magazine reported that the average rating assigned by 225 readers to a Kodak compact digital camera was 7.5. For this product, identify the following:

A.The population
B.The parameter of interest
C.The sampling frame
D.The sample size
E.The sampling design
F.Any potential sources of bias or other problems with the survey or sample

Ans :
The population = All the users of electronics 

The parameter of interest   =brand satisfaction = ratings

The sampling frame = list of all readers of PC Magazine who were asked to participate in the survey.

The sample size = 9000

The sampling design=  convenience sampling approach

Any potential sources of bias or other problems with the survey or sample =  
Lack of representativeness = sample is not representative of all the electronic users.
Ans :

3.For each of the following statements, indicate whether it is True/False. If false, explain why.

I.If the 95% confidence interval for the average purchase of customers at a department store is $50 to $110, then $100 is a plausible value for the population mean at this level of confidence.

Ans :	True  

II.If the 95% confidence interval for the number of moviegoers who purchase concessions is 30% to 45%, this means that fewer than half of all moviegoers purchase concessions.

Ans : 
False : 95 % CI  refers to the range within which we are 95% confident that the true population proportion lies. It does not imply that fewer than half of all moviegoers purchase concessions. 

III.The 95% Confidence-Interval for μ only applies if the sample data are nearly normally distributed.  

Ans : 
False: As the Central Limit Theorem suggests for large enough data the small sample  eventually be a normal distribution so even if the original population is not normally distributed we can create a confidence interval.(sample size should be more than 30)


4.What are the chances that?

A.¼ 
B.½ 
C.¾ 
D.1

Ans : Insufficient information.We need more information about the distribution and sample to give this answer.

# 5.In January 2005, a company that monitors Internet traffic (WebSideStory) reported that its sampling revealed that the Mozilla Firefox browser launched in 2004 had grabbed a 4.6% share of the market.

I.If the sample were based on 2,000 users, could Microsoft conclude that Mozilla has a less than 5% share of the market?

  : Probably not because 2000 users may not be the representative of actual population in this case. Larger sample might reduce the margin of error


II.WebSideStory claims that its sample includes all the daily Internet users. If that’s the case, then can Microsoft conclude that Mozilla has a less than 5% share of the market?

Ans :. If WebSideStory claims that its sample includes all daily Internet users, then Microsoft could reasonably conclude that Mozilla has a less than 5% share of the market.

# 6.A book publisher monitors the size of shipments of its textbooks to university bookstores. For a sample of texts used at various schools, the 95% confidence interval for the size of the shipment was 250 ± 45 books. Which, if any, of the following interpretations of this interval are correct?

A.All shipments are between 205 and 295 books. False 

B.95% of shipments are between 205 and 295 books. False

C.The procedure that produced this interval generates ranges that hold the population mean for 95% of samples. True

D.If we get another sample, then we can be 95% sure that the mean of this second sample is between 205 and 295. False

E.We can be 95% confident that the range 160 to 340 holds the population mean.  False 



7.Which is shorter: a 95% z-interval or a 95% t-interval for μ if we know that σ =s?

A.The z-interval is shorter
B.The t-interval is shorter
C.Both are equal
D.We cannot say

Ans : D We cannot say  this is told to be the incorrect correct answer is  A.

Questions 8 and 9 are based on the following: To prepare a report on the economy, analysts need to estimate the percentage of businesses that plan to hire additional employees in the next 60 days.

# 8.How many randomly selected employers (minimum number) must we contact in order to guarantee a margin of error of no more than 4% (at 95% confidence)?

A.600
B.400
C.550
D.1000

Ans: 
n = (Z * σ / E)^2

where:
n = sample size
Z = Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (95% confidence corresponds to a Z-score of approximately 1.96)
σ = estimated standard deviation (unknown in this case, so we can use 0.5 to estimate)
E = desired margin of error (4% or 0.04)


n = (1.96 * 0.5 / 0.04)^2 ≈ 600.25

# 9. Suppose we want the above margin of error to be based on a 98% confidence level. What sample size (minimum) must we now use?

A.1000
B.757
C.848
D.543

Ans :
The Z-score for a 98% confidence level is approximately 2.33.

n = (Z * σ / E)^2

n = (2.33 * 0.5 / 0.04)^2 ≈ 848.81
